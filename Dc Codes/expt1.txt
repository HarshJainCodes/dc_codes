% Write a program to plot PDF of a Gaussian (Normal) Random Variable for: 
%      CASE-1 Standard Gaussian: mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1
%      CASE-2 General Gaussian: mean = 1 and standard deviation = 1 
%      CASE-3 General Gaussian: mean = -1 and standard deviation = 1
%      CASE-4 General Gaussian: mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.5 
%      CASE-5 General Gaussian: mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0.5
%      CASE-6 General Gaussian: mean = 1 and standard deviation = 0.5        

% Plotting Case-1: 
  m = 0;        # Given: mean = 0
  sd = 1;       # Given: standard deviation = 1
  x=-6:0.1:6; # Define suitable range of x values (as per our choice). 
  y=normpdf(x,m,sd); # Calculate values of Normal PDF for all xs. 
# Note: The 'normpdf' function belongs to the statistics package.
#       To load the package,run 'pkg load statistics' from the Octave prompt
#       in command window before running this program.

  figure(1)   # Open a figure window named as figure-1.  
# We wish to plot all the cases (Total 6 Plots) in the same figure window.
# Use 2 rows & 3 columns so that we have total 6 plots as shown below.

#           |  4  |  5  |  6  |

  subplot(2,3,1)  # The plot (Case-1) will be on location-1 as shown above. 
  plot(x,y)       # To plot Case-1 (y vs x).     
  axis([-6 6 0 1]) # x-axis ranges from -10 to 10 & y-axis ranges from 0 to 1.

% Write the code yourself to plot Case-2 on Location-2 with given mean and 
% standard deviation.
